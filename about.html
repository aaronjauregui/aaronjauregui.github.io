## About

Hi! I am Aaron Ulises Jauregui Zepeda (or just Aaron).  I am very passionate about computer science, particularly software security, machine learning, and embedded systems. I am currently studying a <a href="https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2020/program/AACOM" target="_blank">Batchelor's of Advanced Computing (Honours) at the ANU</a>. I am a Student ambassador and a Tutor (Teaching Assistant) at ANU's College of Engineering and Computer Science.

I was born and raised in Mexico, and was lucky enough to be able to attend the Australian National University for my batchelor's (which I'm doing now), and I also went on exchange to Japan when I was in high school. I am fluent in Spanish, English, and Japanese.
